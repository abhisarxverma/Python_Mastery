# LAST CHANGES
Things I worked on last time.

- Fixed the circular import problem
- Fixed the command line, which has started working

## NEXT TASKS
Need to do next

- Loans creation and saving is not working, need to make that work
- I have to fix the loan data export, so that the library system remembers the previous loans of the user
- Currently I have to make sure that the command line works fully, then I will move for the sixth assignment from the chatGPT, Which will be more harder and will make me learn more.
