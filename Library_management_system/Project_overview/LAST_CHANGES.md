# LAST CHANGES
***Things I worked on last time.***

- Created new files for every service in the system
- Slowly I am putting the function in their own modules, to make the code not coupled and easy to change.
- Learnt new thing that with the traceback module, we can know that when the error occurs in which function the error occured. in the stack trace sequence in the traceback, the last element is the function that raised the error and the last second is the function inside which the function was called that raised the error.

## NEXT TASKS
***Need to do next***

- Clean the DataService file more
- Cleanly divide the funcitons of the library and then integrate them in library.
- Make the command line work with the new system.
