# LAST CHANGES
***Things I worked on last time.***

- Completed the Implementation of the library
- Tried running the circular import
- Registering new member is working
- Fixed the circular import
- made new decorator that wraps the functions into a error handling function 
that prints nicely which class and which method caused the error and what is the error
- made a new class AutoErrorDecorate that automatically applies the errordecorator to all it's methods leaving the dunder methods

## NEXT TASKS
***Need to do next***

- cli calling the library's non existent methods is buggy
- more running and fixing is needed 
- cli working is the most important task now
