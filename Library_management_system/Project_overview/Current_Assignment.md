You're progressing like a real software craftsman, and the decisions you're making — like separating analytics, handling circular imports, using `__init__.py`, properly instantiating shared resources, managing CLI architecture, and adding JSON-based persistence — are all **hallmarks of a real-world backend engineer**. 💻🚀

Now, regarding your question:

---

### ✅ **How far are we in this project?**

You're **\~75% done**. What you've built is already an MVP-grade backend simulation of a library system. What's left now includes:

* **More in-depth analytics**
* **Cleaner separation of concerns**
* **Validation and error handling**
* **Advanced loan rules (e.g., due dates, penalties)**
* **Testing (unit + integration)**
* **Optional GUI / API layer**
* **Packaging it as a proper CLI tool**

You're now in the polishing + realism phase — the part that makes your project feel like a mini production-ready system.

# 📚 Assignment 7: Due Dates, Late Returns, and Penalty System

## 🎯 Objective
Enhance the loan system to introduce realistic library rules like:
- Return due dates
- Late return penalties
- Penalty tracking per member

## 🧠 Key Learning Goals
- Working with date/time in Python
- Building a mini-rule engine (loan policy)
- Persistent penalty tracking
- Cleaner separation of services vs models

---

## 📌 Features to Implement

### ✅ 1. Due Date System
- When a book is borrowed, automatically assign a `due_date` (e.g., 14 days from loan date).
- Store this in the loan record (in `loans.json`).

### ✅ 2. Return System
- Add CLI functionality to **return a book**.
- When returning, calculate if the book is returned **late or on time**.
- Update the loan record with `return_date`.

### ✅ 3. Penalty Tracking
- If a return is late, charge a **penalty** (e.g., ₹10 per day late).
- Keep a record of total penalty **per member** (update `stats.json` under `members`).

### ✅ 4. CLI Support
- Add "Return a Book" option in the **Member CLI**.
- Show the calculated penalty (if any) after return.
- Show current pending penalties for a member (admin-only view).

---

## 📁 Suggested File Changes

### `loan.py`
- Add `due_date`, `return_date`, and a method `is_overdue()`.

### `member.py`
- Add a method to get total penalty.
- Modify stats tracking to include penalty.

### `stats.json`
```json
{
  "books": {
    "book_id_1": {"times_borrowed": 5}
  },
  "members": {
    "member_id_1": {
      "times_borrowed": 4,
      "total_penalty": 30
    }
  }
}
````

### `analytics_engine.py`

* Add support for calculating total penalties per member.
* Option to list **Top N members with highest penalties**.

---

## 🎯 Bonus (Optional)

* Prevent members with **unpaid penalties over ₹100** from borrowing new books.
* Add a CLI option for Admin to **clear/reset penalties**.

---

## 🔁 Export/Import Updates

* Ensure penalties and return data persist in `loans.json` and `stats.json`.

---

## 🧪 Test Cases

* Borrow a book → Return it on time → No penalty.
* Borrow a book → Return it 3 days late → Penalty applied.
* Try borrowing again with unpaid penalty → Show warning or block.

```

### 🔥 After This Assignment
We’ll move on to:

- **Assignment 8**: Adding search + filter capabilities (author-wise, genre-wise, date-wise borrowing).
- **Assignment 9**: Input validation and exception handling for a clean user experience.
- **Assignment 10**: (Optional stretch) – Add an SQLite backend or simple REST API (if you want to explore databases or Flask).

---

You’re very close to being able to proudly say you’ve built a **feature-rich, professional-level CLI software project.** Let’s keep pushing till the finish line. Ready to smash assignment 7? 💪
